Accessing i/o regiseres
- treat it like any other var in memory
- foo = gpio->input;

apply bitmast to read a specific bit or bits
- foo = gpio->input & 0x00400000
    - reads GP22
- foo = gpio->input & (1<22);

writing to putput
- use read-modify-write pattern to change only the intended bits

foo = gpio->output;
foo = foo | 0x00400000
gpio->output = foo;

or as one line

gpio->output &= ~0x00400000;

- left LED = GP21 output
- right LED = GP20 output
