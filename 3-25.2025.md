Code injection attack
---
---

Disassemble code
- objdump -d ./target > target.d

Injecting and executing new code
- writse assembly code
- determine byte representation of code
- construct string with
    - machine code
    - return address of first injected instruction
- when vulnerable procedure returns, exploit code executes

gcc -S mycode.asm

put attack string between buffer and return address

Buffer overflow defense 
- make it hard to know what the address of the buffer is
- dont use gets
- if possible use a language that checks string bounds
- limit the number of charactersread/copied
    - gets -> fgets
- dont trust code you didnt compile... and not even then

compile-level protection introduce stack canaries
- adds code to detect buffer overflow
- pulls ranomly-selected value from read-only memory
- places it between buffer and return address
- before function return, compares value on stack to value in memory
- if values dont match buffer overflow occured
