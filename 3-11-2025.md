C's null terminated strings

- C treats strings as arrays of chars
- doesnt store a strings size
- C's designers choseASCII NUL, 0x00

why ASCII NUL?
- character has to be something
- comparison operations built on top of concepts of ==0, !=0, >0, <0

registers in x86

ax (rax) - accumulator (return val)
bx - base register - where you put the base address for a array
cx - counter 
dx - data
si - source index
di - destination index
dp - base pointer used on stack
sp - stack pointer


Jump table recipie for switch case
---
pretty much a lookup table for a given var and get the target for the jump from the table

- not on exam lol

Function Calls/Returns
---

caller
- procedure making the call

callee
- procedure being called

Program stack
- region of memory used to keep trac of procedure call chain and store local variables

- (mostly) managed as a stack
    - LIFO

pushq src
- fetch operand from src
- decrement %rsp by 8
- store operand to address held by %rsp

- same as
    - subq $8, %rsp
    - movq src, %rsp

popq 
- load operand from address held by %rsp
- increment %rsp by 8
- save operand to R dest

- same as
    - movq (%rsp), Rdest
    - addq $8, %rsp
