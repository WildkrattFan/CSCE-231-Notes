Exception control flow
---
___

hardware exceptions aren't always bad
 - control transfrred to OS kernel due event
    - divison by zero
    - page fault
    - i/o request
    - etc

- control given to exception handler
    - each exception type has its own handler

Interrupts / asynchronous exceptions
- caused by events external to processor
- unpredictable timing - not caused by code being executed

- exampless
    - timer
    - arrival or data over network
    - keypress
- handler returns control to next instruction

Synchronous exceptions
- triggered by instruction being executed
- trap
    - intentional exception
    - ex: system call, breakpoint trap
    - handler returns control to next instruction

system call
- syscall assembly instruction

- fault
    - unintential exception
    - possibly recoverable
    - recoverable ex: page fault
        - handler returns control to current instruction
    - unrecoverable ex: seg fault
        - handler aborts process
- abort
    - unintentional exception
    - unrecoverable
    - example: illegal instruction
    - handler aborts process



rasberry pi pico interrupts
- we can poll the timer
- we can handle timer interrupts
- we can poll the pins
- we can handle interrupts from the pins

Exceptional control flow

___

context switch
- siilar to exception
    - exception handler returns control to same prcess
    - context switch returns control to different process
- illusion of never having been interrupted is preserved by saving/restoring context
