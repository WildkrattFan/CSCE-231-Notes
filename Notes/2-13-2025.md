5 3/64

101.000011

truncate off to 101.00 bc the third bit on the decimal side is 0

1 59 / 64 * $2^3$

1.111011 * $2 ^ 3$
round to nearest 8th place

1.111 * $2^3$


1 $54/64$ * $2^3$ = 1.110110 * $2^3$

round to 8th place round up because there is a 1 to the right of the 8th place and at least one more one out there

1.111 * $2^3$



1 $52/64$ * $2^3$ = 1.110100 * $2^3$
round down because you round to the nearest even
1.110 * $2^3$

1 $44/64$ * $2^3$ = 1.101100 * $2^3$
round up because you round up to the nearest even meaning the last bit should be 0
1.110 * $2^3$

in QP - bias in 7

0 _ _ _ _ 110 bias = 7

3 + 7 = 10 = 1010

0  1010  110

floating point multiplication 
---

$m_1 * 2^{exp1} * m_2 * 2^{exp2} = (m_1*m_2) * 2^{exp1 + exp2} $

$(5/4 * 2^3) * 1/2 * 2^1$ = 10 * 1 = 10

$5/4 * 1/2 * 2^{3+1}$

$5/8 * 2^4$

$5/8 * 16$

$= 10$


Now in binary 

1.01 * $2^3 * 0.10 * 2^1$

normalize if you want 

$1.01 * 2^3 * 1 * 2^0$

$(1.01 * 1) * (2^3)$

1.01 * 1.0 = 1.01 * $2^3$
= 1010


$m_1 / m_2 * 2^{exp1-exp2}$

Floating point addition
---
1.010 * $2*3 + 1.000 * 2^0$

$1.010 * 2^3 + 0.001000 2^3$


$1.011000 * 2^3$

Its pretty much the same thing for subtraction 

Assembly Language
---

From C code to machine code

-Compiling a program involves many steps
    - gcc -o foo bar.c baz.c
- compiler: generates assembly code
    - gcc -S
- Assembler: generates object code
    - gcc -c or as
- linker creates executable 
    - gcc or ld


C code -> ASM code -> object code -> program

Data types: 
- integer
    - data: 1,2,4,8 bytes
    - addreses: size depends on architecture

- flaoting point
    - data: 4,8, (10),(16) bytes
- no arrays structs, etc...
    - only exist as contigous bytes in memory

Layers of absraction
- Instruction set architecture (ISA) - defines assembly instructions 

TWO classes of ISA
- complex instruction set computer
    - driven by limitations of early computers
- reduced instruction set computer
    - driven by advances in semiconductor technoogy

Complex instruction set computer 
- variable length instruction
- few general purpose registers
- stack intensive function calls
    - necessary due to shortage of general purpose registers
reduced instruction set computer 
- fixed length instructions
- ample general purpose registers
- register intensive function calls
- only load/store access memory 
    - simplifies instructions - only one calculation per instruction
    - assums compiler will generate assemly code
