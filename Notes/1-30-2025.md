Encoding integers

Integer overflow- what happens when we do arithmatic and get an answer that is too big to fit in the variable (think bit/byte size)

If the last carry out differs from the initial carry in then over flow occurred

Signed integers
the first (most significant) bit is the sign of the number 
0 - not negative 
1 - negative 

sign extention - preserve the value of signed bits by extending the bits out indefinetly with 1s

1000 + ~1000
1000 + 01111 =
1111
the bitwise of anything added to its compliment = -1

-x = ~x + 1

Casting between integer types

you can cast between signed shorts and unsigned shorts

short s = -53
(unsigned short)s = 65483

by default constants are signed integers
