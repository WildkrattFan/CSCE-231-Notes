Multi-byte vales in memory addresses

Address specifies byte in memory

multi byte values address is the lowest address

- Little endian places least significant byte at the lowest address
most systems use little endian 


Source -> assembly -> object -> executable

Think of pointers like an envelope 

C strings
- Array of ASCII charaters
- terminated with ASCII Nul 
    - '\0'
    - 0x00

- byte ordering not relevant
    - A string is not a multibyte type
    - a string is an arrayof 1-byte char
    - a string is a pointer to a char

Bit operations
---
___

Logical operators
- operatnds are any integer type
- false = 0
- true = non-zero
- AND &&
- OR ||
- NOT !

Bitwise operators
- and &
- or |
- NOT ~
- XOR ^

Bit shift operators

- left shift x << y
    - move x's bits to the left by y positions
    - fill with 0s on the right
    - truncate excess bits on left

- right shift x >> y
    - movex'sbits to the right by y 
    - truncate excess bits on right
    - logical shift: fill with 0s on left
    - arithmetic shift: duplicate leftmost bit

    Bit masks: setting/clearing a bit

Integers
---
___

Unsigned integers


Recitation
---
___

ASCII table
--
- developed - based on character encoding used for telegraph system
- standard set up by competent authority sa a rule or model
- code system of signals or symbols used for communication

composed of 7 bits, can be round up to 8 bits to make a byte
- how many character can I create with 7 bits? - 128
type man ascii in the terminal to get the ascii table

Math Review 
--
Two important terms

the last significant bit is the last bit (most right) $2^0$
most significant bit is the first bit (most left)

Weighted sum
$3798_{10}$ = $3*10^3+7*10^2+9*10^1+8*10^0$

1011 = $2^3*1+2^2*0+2^1+1*2^0$

ED6 = $14*16*2+13*16^1+6*16^0$

Bin $\rightarrow$ Decimal 
1110 1101 0110 = $2^{11}+2^{10}+2^9+2^7+2^6+2^4+2^2+2^1$
= 2048 + 1024 + 512 + 128 + 84 + 16 + 4 + 2
= 3789

0110 = 6
1101 0111 = 1 + 2 + 4 + 16 + 64 + 128 = 215


Decimal $\rightarrow$ Bin

___Repeated Division___
- divide by 2 the decimal with remainder
- divide result until = 0
- first remainder -> least significant 
- last remainder -> most significant

3798 / 2 = 1899 r 0 
1899 / 2 = 949 r 1
949 / 2 = 478 r 1
478 / 2 = 239 r 0
239 / 2 = 119 r 1
119 / 2 = 59 r 1
59 / 2 = 29 r 1
29 / 2 = 14 r 1
14 / 2 = 7 r 0
7 / 2 = 3 r 1
3 / 2 = 1 r 1
1 / 2 = 0 r 1

Binary version = 1110 1111 0110

___Repeated Subtraction___
- find the closest power of 2 that is less than your number
- subtract it from your number and write r = 1
- Decrease subtraction by a power of 2
- subtract new subtracted from previous result 
- if r < 0  dont note the result and write r = 0
- if result > 0 write new result and write r = 1
- repeat until result = 0

first r is the most significant
last r is the least significant 

3798 - 2048 = 1750 r = 1
1750 - 1024 = 726 r = 1
726 - 512 = 214 r = 1
214 - 256 = x  r = 0
214 - 128 = 86 r = 1
86 - 64 = 22 r = 1
.
.
.
etc.

___Bin $\rightarrow$ Hex___

- create pack of 4 from your bitstring 
- write them in order

1011 | 1111 | 0111 
ox 3F7

___Hex $\rightarrow$ Bin___
convert directly
9F7
1001 1111 0111
100111110111

____Hex $\leftarrow \rightarrow$ Dec____
- weighted sum in base 16
- repeated subtraction in base 16
- repeated division in base 16

best way to convert is
Decimal $\rightarrow$ binary $\rightarrow$ hexadecimal
