Multi-byte vales in memory addresses

Address specifies byte in memory

multi byte values address is the lowest address

- Little endian places least significant byte at the lowest address
most systems use little endian 


Source -> assembly -> object -> executable

Think of pointers like an envelope 

C strings
- Array of ASCII charaters
- terminated with ASCII Nul 
    - '\0'
    - 0x00

- byte ordering not relevant
    - A string is not a multibyte type
    - a string is an arrayof 1-byte char
    - a string is a pointer to a char

Bit operations
---
___

Logical operators
- operatnds are any integer type
- false = 0
- true = non-zero
- AND &&
- OR ||
- NOT !

Bitwise operators
- and &
- or |
- NOT ~
- XOR ^

Bit shift operators

- left shift x << y
    - move x's bits to the left by y positions
    - fill with 0s on the right
    - truncate excess bits on left

- right shift x >> y
    - movex'sbits to the right by y 
    - truncate excess bits on right
    - logical shift: fill with 0s on left
    - arithmetic shift: duplicate leftmost bit

    Bit masks: setting/clearing a bit

Integers

___

Unsigned integers
