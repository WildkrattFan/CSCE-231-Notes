Risc's instruction sets are all the same length

RISC 
- fixed lengths instructions
- more general purpose register
- less stack intensive 
- load / store architecture
- assume that the compiler is generating the assembly code

CISC
- variable length instructions
- fewer general purpose registers
- more stack intensive
- almost every instruction can access memory
- has instructions convenient for Hand-Programming 



Register - place to put data that doesnt have to be in memory

x86 Assembly language
---
___

CISC Philosophy -  give programmers what they need
- retronym for pre-RISC ISAs

- common programming actions typically require 1 assembly instruction

x8 is binary backwards compatible from 9086 
Added more features as time goes on
- replaced features but preserved legacy features for backwards-compatibility 
- lots of KRUFT

CISC SA, but achives RISC level speed
- has RISCy core
- dynamically translates x86 CISC instructions into RISC micro ops

x86 operand types

Immediate
- constant integer values 
- prefixed with $
- EX: $8, $0x40, $-52

Register
- one of the 16 general purpose registers
    - some have particular uses
- ex: %rax, %rsi, %r13
- evaluates to regisrers contents: Reg[%r13]

Memory
- 1,2,4,or 8 bytes of consecutive memory
- addressin a register; (parantheses) derefrence address
- various addressing modes; simplest example (%rsi)
- evalutes to memory locations contents; Mem[Reg[%rsi]]

x86 move instructions
- movq source, destination
- copies data- leaves original copy in place


x86 operation suffixes
- b - operate on a  bit byte
- w - operate on a 16 bit word

- I - operate on a 32 bit long word

- q - operate on a 64 bit quad word

x86 operation suffixes
- gcc will promote bytes and words to long words if destination is register

x86 addressing modes
- simplest takes a pointer out of register and dereferences it 
- movq 42, (%r13)

- Displacement 
    - register specifies start of memory region
    - D is the displacement value
    - corresponds to dereferencing a pointer following pointer arithmetic 
    - movq 42, 16(%r13)

- Indexed (for arrays)
    - register R specifies start of memory region 
    - corresponds to array indexin in C
    - register Ri is the index register
    - S is the scale - must be 1,2,4, or 8
        - if absent S = 1
    - xyzzy[plugh] = 42;   movq 42, (%r13, %rsi, 8)
    - address = register adress * index within the register * the scale (# of bytes) that each thing in the index takes up

- General form addressing mode 
    - combines indexed and displacement fmodes
    - farticually useful if array is allocated on stack
    - mov1 42,  16(%rsp, %rsi, 8)

- all other forms take default values from gerneral form 
    - default D = 0
    - Default Reg[Rb] = 0
    - Default Reg[Ri] = 0
    Default S = 1
D(,Ri,S) indexes array with known fixed addresses


First arg %rdi
second arg %rxi
return value %rax
