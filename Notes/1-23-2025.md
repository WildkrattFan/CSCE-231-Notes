when converting large decimal numbers to binary apply weighted sums
- ones place adds 0 or 1
twos place adds 0 or 2
fours place adds 0 or 4
eights place adds 0 or 8
...
$2^i$'s place adds 0 or $2^i$

11010010 = $2^7 + 2^6+0+2^4+0+0+2^1+0$

01111001 = $1+ 0 + 0+ 8+16+32+64+0$ = 121

Ob1111 0010 = 0 + 2 + 0 + 0 + 16 + 32 + 64 + 128 = 241

converting binary to decimal
- repeatidly divide by 2

210 / 2 = 105 r 0 = 0
105 / 2 = 52 r 1 = 10
52 / 2 = 26 r 0 = 010
26  2 = 13 r 0 = 0010
13 / 2 = 6 r 1 = 1 0010
6 /2 = 3 r 0 = 01 0010
3 / 2 = 1 r 1 = 101 0010
1 / 2 = 0 r 1 = 1101 0010

231 / 2 = 115 r 1 = 1
115 / 2 = 57 r 1 = 11
57 / 2 = 28 r 1 = 111
28 / 2 = 14 r 0 = 0111
14 / 2 = 7 r 0 = 0 0111
7 / 2 = 3 r 1 = 10 0111
3 / 2 = 1 r 1 = 110 0111
1 / 2 = 0 r 1 = 1110 0111

67 / 2 = 33 r 1 = 1
33 / 2 = 16 r 1 = 11
16 / 2 = 8 r 0 = 011
8 / 2 = 4 r 0 = 0011
4 / 2 = 2 r 0 = 0 0011
2 / 2 = 1 r 0 = 00 0011
1 / 2 = 0 r 1 = 100 0011

decimal to binary 
- repeatedly subtract by powers of 2

210 - 128 = 82 1 = 1
82 - 64 = 18 1 = 11
18 - 32 < 0 0 = 110
18 - 16 = 2 1 = 1101
2 - 8 < 0 0 = 11010
2 - 4 < 0 0 = 110100
2 - 2 = 0 1 = 1101001
0 - 1 < 0 0 = 11010010

392 - 256 = 136 1 = 1
136 - 128 = 8 1 = 11
8 - 64 = ... 0
8 - 32 = ... 0
8 - 16 = ... 0
8 - 8 = 0 1
0 - 4 = ... 0
0 - 2 = ... 0
0 - 1 = ...0

Converting
Hex <---> decimal 

Treat as chained conversion between decimal & binary and binary & hex

From Bits to Bytes

Byte stands for "by eight"

8 bits
Binary: 0b00000000 to 0b11111111
Hexadeciml: 0x00 to 0xFF

as an integer 0 to 255 or -128 to 127
As character
128 ASCII characters plus 128 non-standard "Extended ASCII" characters or the first 128 UTF-8 characters (with most significant bit fixed as 0)

Word
--
"Word size"
- size of data representations inside processor
- often nominal size of integer, memory address

- Older machines
    - 8 bit (1 bite) -z80,6520
- typical modern microprocessor - 64 bit (8 byte)

- data types may be 1 word, multiple words or a fraction of a word
    - almost always an exact integer number of bytes

Muli-byte values in memory addresses
- address specifies byte in memory
- multi - byte values address is the lowest address

subsequent values addresses differ by 
- 2 (16 bit type)
- 4 (32 bit type)
- 8 (64 bit type)
