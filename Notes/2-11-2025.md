normal: E any combo except all 0s and all 1s 

exponent = E - bias
E = exponent + bias

Subnormal Numbers
---- 
___
- values too low for normal numbers
    - aka denormal numbers
if E = 000.0 and the fraction != 0 then it is subnormal

- significcands leading digit is implicty 0 m = 0.fraction
- Exponent: exponent = 1 - bias
- tradeoff precision for ability to represent values closer to 0
    - less and less precision as values get closer and closer to 0
smallest normal #

1.000 * $2^{-6}$

largest subnormal number

E field is all 0s so it is subnormal
0.111 * $2^{-6}$

Look at how small using dnormal values lets us get compared to normal


zero numbers
- values too low for subnormal numbers
    - mathematically does not have to be exactly 0

E = 000.00 fraction =000..00

Special values
---
___
infinity
- +- $inf$
- value too great for normal numbers

- E = 111...11
- fraction = 000...00

largest normal

0 1110 111 + 1 = 0 1111 000 = $inf$

NaN
- not a number
- no numeric value can be determined

- E = 111...11
- fraction != 000..00

In normal the precision is limited by #bits for fraction
greatest non-nfinite magnitude limited by #bits for exp

reduced precision as value approaches zero
least non-zero magnitude limited by #bits for frac

Rounding

___

1.1001001 * $2^3$

Floating point operations: compute exactly, then round
- FP arithmetic approximates real arithmatic

Limited preision
- science class: calculation result cannot be more precise than original data
    - round to approriate number of significant digits

- binary FP: calculation result cannot be more precise than data type
    - round to fit in available size

Typical for real numbers: round x to neaest x'
    - what if x is exactly halfway between x- and x+

Integer types: always round toward zero
- 1.9999999 rounds to 1

- FP types: five rounding modes
ex with decimal: round to one decimal place

nearest even (default)
1.34 = 1.3
1.36 = 1.4
1.35 = 1.4
1.45 = 1.4
-1.35 = -1.4

nearest away from zero

1.34 = 1.3
1.36 = 1.3
1.35 = 1.3
1.45 = 1.4
-1.35 = -1.3

round up and round down no matter what


Binary fractional numbers
- even = LSB is 0
- "less than halfway" = bit to right of LSB is 0
