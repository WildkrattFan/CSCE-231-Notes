to convert from mixed fraction form to binary decimal first determine how many points back you need to go 
- each point back is 1/2^n, then simply take the normal binary form of the top of the fraction and plug it in as normal

certain numbers such as .1 can't be represented exactly in fixed point #s

Fixed point #s can't represent both large and small values

this can be fixed with floating point numbers

Decimal fixed point hack
- if unit is a tenth/hundredth/thousandth/etc. then store as integer and use softwareto insert decimal point
- can introduce insidious bug

Floating point: The radix-point "floats" among the significands digits, its position is defined by an exponential factor

normalized floating point: the integer portion of the significand consists of exactly one non zero digit

scientific notation is normalized floating point:
