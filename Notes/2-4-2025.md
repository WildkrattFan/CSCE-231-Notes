if the inputs have different signs then overflow isnt possible in binary

-1 < 0 but -1 > 0U

-1 > -2 and (unsigned) -1 > -2

when casting from a larger type to a smaller type:
- truncate, reinterpret remaining bits

Integer Multiplication and Division 

If the compiler knows either operand is power of 2 it will substitute with a left shift

5 * 20
(4 + 1) * ( 16 + 4)

5 * 16 + 5 * 4
5 * 2^4 + 5 * 2^2
5 << 4 + 5 << 2

Every int can be represented as a sum of powers of 2

Division is very computationally expensive (hundreds of clock cycles)



x >> y = floor(x/2^y)

Overflow: undefined behavior of an operation

Unsigned: Result of operation exceed the allocated number of bit

Signed: Sign of the result is not coherent with the operator

`+ added to a  + = -`
`- added to a - = +`
