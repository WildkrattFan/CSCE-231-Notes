Addr(row i ) = base address of nested array + i * size of (row)

sizeof(row) = number of columns * sizeof(element)

base addr of array + row number * (number of columns * sizeof(element))

addr(i,j) = address of row + column number j * sizeof(element)

baseaddr of array + row number i 8 (number of col + size of element) + col number j * sizeof element

base addr of array + ((row number * number of columns) + col number) * sizeof element

Java doesnt do nested arrays...

Iliffe Vectors
---
___
iliffe vectors = array of pointers to arrays 

Structs
---
___
aka record 
- effectively the data portion of a class
- contiguous region of memory
- heterogeneous data (contains many types)

Memory-aligned field placement 
- adds padding to a struct so they arent completely sequential
- padding ensures that the item within the struct starts at a number divisible by the size of the thing in the struct
- the base address must be divisible by the sizeof the largest element in the struct

Structured programming condition Codes/Flags
---
___

Process state 
- info about executing prgram 
    - data in general purpose register
    - stack pointer
    - program counter
    - condition register / flag register / status register
    - condition codes/flags set by results of recent arithmetic
    - ZF / Z = zero flag
    - SF / N = Sign / Negative flag
    - CF / C = carry flag (unsigned overflow)
    - OF / V = signed overflow flag
