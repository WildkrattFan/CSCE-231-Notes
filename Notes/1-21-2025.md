Introduction
----
its a "hard course"

Syllabus 
* Chapter quizzes 20% - most have 1 quiz, some have multiple 
* 2 attempts each quiz
* Labs are the bulk of the grade
* Some labs are 2 weeks long, last lab is 2 hours long
* Some will be finished during lab time, others take longer
* 10 pt lab - finished during lab time, 20 pt lab, 50% of class will finish during lab time; 30-40 pts, dont put it off
* Lowest quiz and lowest lab drop
* Group project 2 week lab
* Exams,2 Midterms, Final exam is 2 parts, lowest exam grade dropped
* several labs have extra credit, chapter quizzes due after wensday of week 16 will be treated as extra credit applied to chapter quiz portion of grade
* Most announcements through piazza 

Why take this course? 
- computer science is no more about computers than astronomy is about telescopes - edsger Dijkstra

The overheling majority of computer science and software engineering courses rely upon "leaky abstractions"
coined my Joel Spolsky

Morris Worm - first malway that entered the internet, shut down a ton of computers

Languages used in this course
- C
- Assembly (x86, ARM) - oh yes

Planned lesons
- data representation & arithmetic 
- Assembly language
- Processor architecture 
- why is clock speed a poor measure of processor performance?
- concurrency 
- Exception control flow
- System level I/O
    - keyboard mouse
    - printer etc
- memory
- Program optimization



Why does C count 0,1,2,...? - its easier to do in assembly 

Why do C strings end in \0? - because there is no length value to strings so we have to tell something that it is done moving forwards

why does C have an increment operator (i++) - because in assembly it has one 

why does C have ternary operator/
(X = X < y / x : y) - because of assembly 

Representing Data

____

Number Bases 
Base 10
- human standard number base
- Digit = finger
- Digit = eacb numeral in a number representation
- Even carries through in scientific notation

But its hard to implement electronically
- hard to store
    - ENIAC (First electronic computer) used 10 vacuum tubes / digit
- hard to transmit
-  messy to implement digital logic functions

Base 2
- easy to store
    - punch cards / punch tape
    - position of switch
    - voltage amplitude 
- downside
    - not human readable
- GCC allows binary representation with "0b"
    - $10011101_2$ can be written as 0b10011101 

Binary coded Decimal (BCD)
- uses four bits to represent deicmal values
    - easy convesion to human-readable form
    - wiring processors to perform math just as convoluted as ENIAC
Base 16
- hexadecimal or hex
- a more compact representaton of Base 2
    - slightly more human readable than binary
    - each hex digit corresponds to four bits
    - exactly 2 hex digits needed to represet a byte
- in C, indicate hex representation with "0x"
    - $FA1D37B_{16}$ would be written 0xFA1D37B (or lowercase)

Radix Conversions:
--
Binary to Hex, Hex to binary

Hex to binary
- replace hex-digit with corresponding four bits

Binary to Hexadecimal
- separate bits into quartets starting with LSB
- replace each quartet with corresponding hex-digit
