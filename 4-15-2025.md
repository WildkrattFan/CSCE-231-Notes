digital signals
- really continuous signals
- use voltage thresholds to assign discrete values

- use transistors designed to transition quikcly between high and low voltage
    - minimize time transitioning through indeterminant value range
    - transitions from 0 to 1 and from 1 to 0 are not instantaneous

Combinatorial & Sequential Logic

combinatorial logic - outputs depend onlyon its current inputs

sequential logic - outputs depend on sequence of inputs

    - feedback output - output depends on feedback loops

1 cycle per instruction processor
