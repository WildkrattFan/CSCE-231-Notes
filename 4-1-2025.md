process - executable progam, resident in memory, possibly holding resources, sometimes executing on the processor

fork()
- creates a nearly identical process
- parent and child are idential copies except
    - different PIDs 
    - different fork() return val

- void exit(int status)
    - terminates return process
    - process's exit status is status
    - by convention, 0 indicates normal return

context switching 
- periodically switching out processes and running a different one 
- like running a slice of a program then switching and doing that

thread - lightweight process
- flow of control within a process
-still has its own flow of control
- created faster - no need to duplicate address space
- switched in and out faster 
- destroyed faster
