Stack manipulation
---
pushq src
- fetch operand from src
- decrement %rsp by 8
store operand to address held by %rsp

equivalent to 
- sub $8, %rso
- movq src, (%rsp)

popq Rdest
- load operand from address held by %rsp
- increment %rsp by 8
- save operand to Rdest

Procedure Call

- call $<function>$
    - after linking call 0x1234 function #0x1234 is the functions address
    - pushes return adress to stack, jumps to function

- return address is address of instruction immediately following call
    - commonly %rip+5 - a "near call" with a 32-bit offset

ret
- pops return addess from stack into %rip
- resumes execution at instruction pointed to by %rip
    - return address
- equivalent to popq %rip

rdi - 1st arg
rsi - 2nd arg
rdx - 3rd arg
rcx - 4th arg
r8 - 5th
r9 - 6th arg

if you need more they go on the stack

rax - 80byte return value

rdx:rax - 16 byte return value (some compilers, not guaranteed)

buffer overflow
- exceeding an arrays bounds
- most common buffer overflows involve strings allowcated on the stack (stack smashning)

- #1 technical security vulnerability

gets() - most direct way to introduce vulnerability 
- reads from stdin, writes to buffer
