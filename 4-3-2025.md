Accessing devices with C

Direct I/O aka port mapped i/o

typical
- in des, src    out src, est
- copies value from i/o port to memory or general purpose register
-v copies value from memory or general purpsoe register to I/o port


i/o address space disting from memory address space
- requires additional instructions
- less logic needed to decode address
- C must use assembly-code libraries

- i/o device registers reside in memory address space

- any instruction that can use memory can access i/o register
- no special instructions needed
- extra complexity in memory bus design
